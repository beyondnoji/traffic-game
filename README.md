# This is a traffic game which I coded in pygame and which I named "jai_walking" as a play on my name as well as the act of jay-walking. 
# Skills I learnt from making this game:
Firstly I learned how to use external libraries for the first time, and especially how to understand and quickly extract needed information from the documentation.
Moreover, as regards the actual coding of games (in which I have a interest), I learnt about the structure and relation of the main while-loop in which the game takes place. I learnt about the mechanics of event-handling, reading inputs from the user, as well as the drawing of the screen, all of which in tandem constitute the game.  
All in all, coding this game was a project which I think significantly widened my horizon in terms of what I am capable of coding and the kinds of projects I can reasonably undertake in the future. It was a valuable experience.
