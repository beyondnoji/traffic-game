# This is a traffic game which I coded using the pygame library. I made the pixel-art myself from scratch.
# From making this game, I gained and learned the following:
1. I learned how to use external libraries for the first time, and especially how to understand and quickly extract needed information from the documentation.
2. As regards the actual coding of games (in which I have a interest), I learnt about the structure and relation of the main while-loop in which the game takes place. I learnt about the mechanics of event-handling, reading inputs from the user, as well as the drawing of the screen, all of which in tandem constitute the game. I also learned how to integrate background music into the game to make it more lively. 
3. This project significantly widened my horizon in terms of what kind of projects I think I can code. It was the first time I coded a game which was not of the more slow-paced and static kind (e.g., card-games or chess). The jump from static GUIs with little movement, to a screen which updates at 60 frames per second and harbours player movement as well as in-game Sprite movement was a significant jump for my skill in making games.
